'CRITICAL': Indicates a critical error or failure that may cause the program to terminate. The purpose of log levels is to provide a way to filter and prioritize log messages based on their severity. Developers can set the desired log level, and only log messages with an equal or higher level will be recorded. For example:\n",

Logging provides a structured and controlled way to capture relevant information without affecting the program's output.

Logging provides a centralized mechanism for collecting and storing log messages, which can be essential for troubleshooting and post-mortem analysis. Log messages can be directed to different destinations (e.g., console, file, remote server) and can be easily configured or disabled without modifying the code. The logging module offers powerful features such as log levels, handlers, filters, and formatters, which allow you to customize and control the behavior of log messages based on specific requirements."
